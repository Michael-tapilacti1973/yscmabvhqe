# Repository: The Life List // STUNT HISTORY (UNCENSORED)

> Disclaimer: This repository contains a satirical and highly exaggerated "history" of the stunt work (or lack thereof) performed during the production of the film "The Life List", as told by a seasoned, possibly slightly bored, stunt professional. Any resemblance to actual events or levels of danger is purely coincidental.

## Project Description

Logging the true adrenaline-pumping, death-defying saga behind the camera of "The Life List". Spoiler alert: the most dangerous thing was probably the craft services chili. But hey, we were ready for anything. My team and I were there, pads strapped, wires checked, ready to make cinematic magic... or, you know, ensure someone didn't trip too convincingly.

## Production Stunt Log: The Life List (Director's Cut... Not Really)

Alright, pull up a crash mat, kid, and listen. They call me [Stuntman Alias - let's go with "Crash" Cunningham]. Been doing this since before CGI meant you didn't need me to fall off a building. Seen it all. Fire, cars, dragons, zero-G... and then came "The Life List". A real challenge. Of staying awake.

### Phase 1: The "Mild Peril" Pre-Production

Got the script. Read "walks down street," "sits on bench," "looks at photo," "gets slightly damp." Thought it was a typo. Called my agent. "Is this... a documentary about a Tuesday?" He just laughed and said the check cleared.

My team assembled: Fire Safety (for... maybe a candle?), Water Safety (for... rain?), High Falls (just in case gravity suddenly decided to get exciting), and Vehicular Mayhem (a guy who drives the golf cart). We spent weeks polishing crash mats that never saw action and testing wire rigs that were rated for a piano but used for someone leaning.

Key preparation:
   Rigging the park bench (for a standard sit).
   Mapping out the sidewalk (identifying potential tripping hazards like rogue pebbles).
   Developing a complex weather contingency plan (if it rained too hard, someone might need an umbrella... a clear stunt risk).
   Practicing sophisticated 'looking surprised' falls onto pillows (actor didn't need it, thank goodness).

### The Great Bench Collapse of '21 (Attempted)

Scene: Protagonist dramatically sits on a park bench.

   Script: `[Character] sighs and sits.`
   Production Note: "Ensure safe seating."
   My Team's Plan: We designed a full sub-structure under the bench, load-tested it to three times the actor's weight plus emotional baggage, had soft mats strategically placed just out of frame, and two spotters ready to catch them if they somehow defied physics and fell upwards.
   Actual Execution: The actor... sat down. Perfectly normal. Took six takes because the angle of the sunlight hitting the other bench wasn't right. My team practiced complex card tricks behind the camera.


# Scene Log: BENCH_SIT_01
## Stunt Prep: High-level stability check, fall radius calc.
## Gear Used: Load-bearing inserts, hidden crash mats (unused).
## Outcome: Successful sitting. Team disappointed.


### The Infamous Puddle Incident

Scene: Character walks near a puddle.

   Script: `[Character] steps around a small puddle.` (Yes, the script actually specified stepping around.)
   Production Note: "Ensure realistic puddle interaction."
   My Team's Plan: We had divers in full scuba gear on standby, thermal blankets, paramedics trained in hypothermia treatment (it was like 65 degrees Fahrenheit), and rehearsed elaborate 'slipping-into-puddle' choreography with full safety tethers. Built a mini-reservoir off-camera for controlled splashing.
   Actual Execution: Actor... stepped around it. Just like the script said. The director asked if we could get "a little splash." I had to manually flick water from a bottle onto the actor's shoe with my finger. Took four takes because the splash wasn't "meaningful" enough.

python
# Stunt_Puddle_Sequence.py
# Simulates puddle splash physics
def generate_splash(impact_force, puddle_depth):
  if impact_force < 0.1: # If just stepping around
    return "minimal_aerosolization"
  elif impact_force < 0.5: # If light step through
    return "small_splash"
  else: # If intentional jump
    return "epic_splash" # Feature unused in final cut

# Actual Scene:
splash_result = generate_splash(0.05, 0.1) # Very low impact, shallow puddle
print(f"Stunt outcome: {splash_result}")
# Expected: minimal_aerosolization. Reality was even less.


### The Terrifying Bicycle Ballet

Scene: Characters ride bicycles slowly down a path.

   Script: `They ride their bikes side-by-side.`
   Production Note: "Maintain safe distance between bikes."
   My Team's Plan: Prepped full motorcycle helmets (hidden), body armor, breakaway handlebars, and simulated low-speed collision impacts using dummies. Had drone surveillance ready to track potential high-speed wobbles (above 5 mph). Trained stunt doubles in graceful low-speed tumbles onto soft grass.
   Actual Execution: They pedaled. Very gently. Chatting. The biggest risk was hitting a squirrel. We shadowed them on Segways, ready to deploy emergency cushions if anyone looked slightly off-balance for more than 0.5 seconds. My team spent most of this sequence practicing yoga poses on the crash mats.


## Bike Scene Safety Protocol
1. Maintain minimum 3ft separation. VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN.
2. Max speed: 8 mph (reduced to 5 mph on director's request for "emotional resonance").
3. Helmets optional for actors (sigh), mandatory for stunt doubles (double sigh).
4. Emergency stop procedure: Apply brakes gently. Disembark carefully.

Note: Protocol 1 was almost violated when one actor pointed enthusiastically at a flower. Crisis averted by sharp whistle from Stunt Co-ordinator.


### The Emotional Tightrope Walk (Actor's Problem)

Scene: Character has a heartfelt conversation.

   Script: `[Character] tearfully recounts memory.`
   Production Note: "Ensure emotional authenticity."
   My Team's Plan: Absolutely nothing. This was the actors' domain. We were ready to step in if someone had to dramatically collapse onto furniture (safely, of course), but no such luck. We mostly just stayed out of the way and tried not to make noise adjusting our unused safety belts.
   Actual Execution: Lots of talking, crying, meaningful glances. We debated the tensile strength of a single tear (negligible, for the record).


# Stunt Log: EMOTIONAL_CLIMAX_01
## Stunt Prep: N/A (Actor Action)
## Gear Used: N/A
## Outcome: High-tension drama observed from a safe distance. Zero physical risk detected. Morale slightly low due to lack of actual stunt work.


## Learnings & Takeaways

   You can prepare for everything and use none of it.
   A good craft services team is crucial for morale on a low-stunt film.
   My team's ability to look busy while doing nothing reached peak performance.
   Park benches are surprisingly sturdy.
   Never underestimate the dramatic potential of a single droplet of water.

This film proved that "The Life List" of a stuntman on a project like this is basically: 1. Show Up. 2. Stay Awake. 3. Go Home.

   The Director, for having absolutely zero dangerous ideas.
   The Producers, for paying us anyway.
   My Stunt Team, for their readiness to face any peril, no matter how imaginary.
